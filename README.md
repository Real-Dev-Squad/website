Welcome to Real Dev Squad

CSS Structure

--> global css
    --> main.css - this css will contain  common css pertaining to all pages that can be used throughout the website. for e.g. a class
    with name success, when used anywhere throughout the website will make the color of the text green.
--> page specific css 
    for example, events page css goes inside events.css 
--> also, in future if we add new components, we will keep component specific css like navbar.css, footer.css, header.css etc
--> for mobile responsive css, we can have a folder with multiple css files catering to different css pertaining to different resolutions
